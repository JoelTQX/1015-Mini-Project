# Predicting Autism Using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

This repository contains code for SC1015 Mini Project that demonstrates the classification of autistic patients using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN).

## Overview

This repository explores the classification of individuals as autistic or non-autistic based on various features. The dataset used in this analysis contains demographic and behavioural features of individuals, and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is trained to predict whether an individual is autistic or not.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this notebook is sourced from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/autism-screening-on-adults/data?select=autism_screening.csv and contains 704 samples with 21 features. The features include demographic information, such as age and gender, as well as behavioural features related to autism spectrum disorder.

## Problem Definition
How are other factors aside from ASD detection testsÂ relevant in predicting autism?

## Methodology

The notebook follows these main steps:

1. **Data Exploration**: Initial exploration of the dataset to understand its structure and characteristics.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocessing steps include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
3. **Model Building**: Construction of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model using TensorFlow/Keras.
4. **Model Training**: Training the ANN model on the preprocessed dataset.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the trained model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. **Results Interpretation**: Interpretation of the results and discussion on the model's performance.

## Models Used

1. Classification
2. Artificial Neural Network

## Requirements

The following libraries are required to run the notebook:

- TensorFlow
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Outcome & Insights

- Analyze feature predictive power
- Provide insights beyond traditional ASD tests
- Emphasize the importance of additional factors

## Conclusion

ASD testing alone may not accurately predict autism, necessitating advanced machine learning and interdisciplinary approaches. Recommendations include collaboration, diverse datasets integration, model refinement, and personalized approaches.
In conclusion, this project offers valuable insights and recommendations for further exploration and interdisciplinary collaboration in understanding and predicting autism spectrum disorder.
