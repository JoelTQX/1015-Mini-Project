# Autistic Patients Classification using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

This repository contains code for SC1015 Mini Project that demonstrates the classification of autistic patients using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN).

## Overview

This notebook explores the classification of individuals as autistic or non-autistic based on various features. The dataset used in this analysis contains demographic and behavioral features of individuals, and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is trained to predict whether an individual is autistic or not.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this notebook is sourced from [INSERT DATASET SOURCE] and contains [INSERT NUMBER OF SAMPLES] samples with [INSERT NUMBER OF FEATURES] features. The features include demographic information, such as age and gender, as well as behavioral features related to autism spectrum disorder.

## Problem Definition
How are other factors aside from ASD detection testsÂ relevant in predicting autism?

## Methodology

The notebook follows these main steps:

1. **Data Exploration**: Initial exploration of the dataset to understand its structure and characteristics.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocessing steps including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
3. **Model Building**: Construction of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model using TensorFlow/Keras.
4. **Model Training**: Training the ANN model on the preprocessed dataset.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the performance of the trained model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. **Results Interpretation**: Interpretation of the results and discussion on the model's performance.

## Usage

To run this notebook, follow these steps:

1. Download the dataset from [INSERT DATASET LINK] and place it in the same directory as the notebook.
2. Open the notebook in a Python environment with necessary libraries installed (e.g., TensorFlow, Pandas, NumPy).
3. Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially.

## Requirements

The following libraries are required to run the notebook:

- TensorFlow
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
